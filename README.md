# tunnel_project1.sql
I wanted to do a realistic project based on road usage. I have completed this sql project about tunnel charges. Here I faced many problems. For example, I had to feed more data later on to see how it performs. Whenever I came across with any problems, I left the note why I have done that or what didn't work in my script without making a fresh one.
